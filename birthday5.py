#birthday5: how it works: ll. 3-17 are the definitions that are read and
#remembered, then the flow goes to the main() line, which executes the
#def main(), which executes in turn the code under happyBirthdayEmily() and
#then happyBirthdayAndre. 

def happyBirthdayEmily():
    print("Happy Birthday to you!")
    print("Happy Birthday to you!")
    print("Happy Birthday, dear Emily.")

    print("Happy Birthday to you!")
